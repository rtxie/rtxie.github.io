For high resource utilization, multiple rendering tasks run in the same GPU server and compete against each other for the computation resource. Each task has its requirement for performance, i.e., QoS target. A significant problem is how to schedule tasks so that each preset QoS is met and the performance of all tasks are maximized. We make the following contributions. First, we formulate the problem into a QoS constrained max-min utility problem. Second, we find that using the common natural logarithm as a utility function overly promotes one performance but demotes another. To avoid this phenomenon, we design a special utility function. Third, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm, consisting of a resolution adjustment algorithm and a frame rate fair scheduling algorithm, both of which interact with each other. The former selects resolutions for tasks and the latter decides which task to process. We evaluate our method with actual rendering data, and the simulations demonstrate that our method can effectively improve task performance as well as satisfy QoS simultaneously.","tags":["Edge Computing; Task Scheduling; Remote Rendering"],"title":"QoS-Aware Scheduling of Remote Rendering for Interactive Multimedia Applications in Edge Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kan Yang","Jiangang Shu","Ruitao Xie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1663082042,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082043,"objectID":"e91b168cbb03dd8b059c6b39265c6083","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/23-tifs-dss/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:14:02.24212Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/23-tifs-dss/","section":"publication","summary":"Towards the large amount of data generated everyday, data selective sharing and acquisition is one of the most significant data services in cloud-based systems, which enables data owners to selectively share their data to some particular users, and users to selectively acquire some interested data. However, it is challenging to protect data security and user privacy during data selective sharing and selective acquisition, because cloud servers are curious about the data or user’s interests, and even send data to some unauthorized users or some uninterested users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and provably secure Data selective Sharing and Acquisition ( DSA ) scheme for cloud-based systems. Specifically, we first formulate a generic data selective sharing and acquisition problem in cloud-based systems by identifying several design goals in terms of correctness, soundness, security and efficiency. Then, we propose the DSA scheme to enable data owners to control the access of their data in a fine-grained manner, and enable users to refine the data acquisition without revealing their interests. Technically, a brand new cryptographic framework is developed to integrate attribute-based encryption with searchable encryption. Finally, we prove that the proposed DSA scheme is correct, sound, secure in the random oracle model, and efficient in practice.","tags":[""],"title":"Efficient and Provably Secure Data Selective Sharing and Acquisition in Cloud-Based Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zaixing Sun","Boyu Zhang","Chonglin Gu","Ruitao Xie","Bin Qian","Hejiao Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1663082042,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082043,"objectID":"77f0eb6e1668580593dc331194927cae","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/22-tsc-et2ef/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:14:02.24212Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/22-tsc-et2ef/","section":"publication","summary":"Cloud computing is an emerging computational infrastructure for cost-efficient workflow execution that provides flexible and dynamically scalable computing resources at pay-as-you-go pricing. Workflow scheduling, as a typical NP-Complete problem, is one of the major issues in cloud computing. However, in the cloud scenario with unlimited resources, how to generate an efficient and economical workflow scheduling scheme under the deadline constraint is still an extraordinary challenge. In this paper, we propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm called enhanced task type first algorithm (ET2FA) to solve deadline-constrained workflow scheduling in cloud with new features such as hibernation and per-second billing. The objectives to be minimized include the total cost and total idle rate. ET2FA involves three phases: 1) Task type first algorithm, which schedules tasks based on topological level and task types, and utilizes a compact-scheduling-condition based VM selection method to assign each task. 2) Delay operation based on block structure, which further optimizes total cost and total idle rate based on block structure properties. 3) Instance hibernate scheduling heuristic, which sets an instance to hibernate if idle for a duration. Extensive simulation experiments based on seven well-known real-world workflow applications show that ET2FA delivers better performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms.","tags":["Workflow Scheduling; Cloud Computing"],"title":"ET2FA: A Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm for Deadline-constrained Workflow Scheduling in Cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Liu","Feiyu Jin","Junbo Hu","Ruitao Xie","Fuqiang Gu","Songtao Guo","Jiangtao Luo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1663082040,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082040,"objectID":"829dbd5e5d8910aa40caa3ad4f398a3c","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/22-tmc-vehicle-tracking/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:14:00.004388Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/22-tmc-vehicle-tracking/","section":"publication","summary":"The variation of wireless signal in dynamic indoor parking environments may seriously compromise the performance of fingerprint-based localization methods.

A third-party auditor (TPA) is introduced in public auditing schemes to verify the integrity of outsourced data on behalf of users. To resist malicious TPAs, many blockchain-based public verification schemes have been proposed. However, existing auditing schemes rely on a centralized TPA, and they are vulnerable to tempting auditors who may collude with malicious blockchain miners to produce biased auditing results. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized public auditing (BDPA) scheme by utilizing a decentralized blockchain network to undertake the responsibility of a centralized TPA, and also mitigate the influence of tempting auditors and malicious blockchain miners by taking the concept of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). A detailed security analysis shows that BDPA can preserve data integrity against tempting auditors and malicious blockchain miners.

Current advances on CTC mainly fall into two categories, $physical-layer CTC$ and $packet-level energy modulation$ (PLEM). The $physical-layer CTC$ achieves a high CTC data rate, but with channel incompatible to commercial devices, making it hard to be deployed in current wireless networks. PLEM is channel and physical layer compatible, but with two main drawbacks of the low CTC data rate and MAC incompatibility, which will induce severe interference to the other devices' normal data transmissions. In this paper, we propose symbol-level energy modulation (SLEM), the first CTC method that is fully compatible with current devices in both channel and the physical/MAC layer processes, having the ability to be deployed in commercial wireless networks smoothly. SLEM inserts extra bits to WiFi data bits to generate the transmitting bits, so as to adjust the energy levels of WiFi symbols to deliver CTC information. We make theoretical analysis to figure out performance of both CTC and WiFi transmissions. We also conduct experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of SLEM and its performance under different network situations.","tags":["Wireless Networks; WiFi; ZigBee; Cross-Technology Communication"],"title":"Cross-Technology Communication for Heterogeneous Wireless Devices through Symbol-Level Energy Modulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junmei Yao","Haolang Huang","Ruitao Xie","Xiaolong Zheng","Kaishun Wu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082028,"objectID":"0a14b4fd1605e47812c4326dc8f45b7a","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/22-icdcs-sledzig/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:13:47.729185Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/22-icdcs-sledzig/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid growth of Internet of Things, the number of heterogeneous wireless devices working in the same frequency band increases dramatically, leading to severe crosstechnology interference.

In this paper, we design and implement SledZig to boost crosstechnology coexistence for low-power devices through both enabling more transmission opportunities and avoiding interference. SledZig is fully compatible with the standard in both physical and MAC layers. It decreases the WiFi signal power on the channel of low-power devices while keeps the WiFi transmission power unchanged, through making constellation points in the overlapped subcarriers have the lowest power, which can be achieved by just encoding the WiFi payload. We implement SledZig on hardware testbed and evaluate its performance under different settings. Experiment results show that SledZig can effectively increase ZigBee transmissions and improve its performance over a WiFi channel under various WiFi data traffic, with as low as 6.94% WiFi throughput loss.","tags":["Cross-Technology Communications; Wireless Networks"],"title":"SledZig: Boosting Cross-Technology Coexistence for Low-Power Wireless Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiangang Shu","Songlei Wang","Xiaohua Jia","Weizhe Zhang","Ruitao Xie","Hejiao Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082043,"objectID":"cd9f10fe1ba94b45e735f7184684dadd","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/22-tits-crowdsourcing/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:14:03.048754Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/22-tits-crowdsourcing/","section":"publication","summary":"By providing rich context of lane information on roads, lane-level maps play a vital role in intelligent transportation systems. Since Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have been widely applied to vehicles, vehicle-based crowdsourcing offers an economical way to the lane-level map building by collecting and analyzing the GPS trajectories of vehicles. However, existing works cannot directly extract lane-level road information from raw and interleaved crowdsourcing trajectories, and moreover they are time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose a lane-level map building scheme, which can directly extract lane-level road information from raw crowdsourcing GPS trajectories with both efficiency and accuracy improvement. Consider the global similarity between trajectories, we design an efficient trajectory segmentation and clustering algorithm based on improved discrete Fréchet distance and entropy theory, which can directly and accurately deal with the interleaved and messy trajectories. To improve the efficiency, we employ the Least Square Estimate (LSE) to constrain Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and design an efficient and accurate lane-level road information extraction algorithm. Comprehensive comparative experiments and performance evaluation on a real-world trajectory dataset show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.","tags":["Crowdsourcing; Vehicles"],"title":"Efficient Lane-Level Map Building via Vehicle-Based Crowdsourcing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruitao Xie","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Nevertheless, it is challenging to process time-critical tasks due to unique characteristics of IoV, including heterogeneous computation and communication capacities of network nodes, intermittent wireless connections, unevenly distributed workload, massive data transmission, intensive computation demands, and high mobility of vehicles. In this article, we propose a two-layer vehicular fog computing (VFC) architecture to explore the synergistic effect of the cloud, the static fog, and the mobile fog on processing time-critical tasks in IoV. Then, we give a motivational case study by implementing a prototype of a traffic abnormity detection and warning system, which demonstrates the necessity and urgency of developing adaptive task offloading mechanisms in such a scenario and gives insight into the problem formulation. Furthermore, we formulate the offloading model, aiming at maximizing the completion ratio of time-critical tasks. On this basis, we propose an adaptive task offloading algorithm (ATOA). Specifically, it adaptively categorizes all tasks into four types of pending lists by considering the dynamic requirements and resource constraints, and then tasks in each list will be cooperatively offloaded to different nodes based on their features. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation. The results demonstrate the superiority of ATOA.","tags":["Offloading; Time-Critical Tasks; Vehicles"],"title":"Adaptive Offloading for Time-Critical Tasks in Heterogeneous Internet of Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruitao Xie","Xiaohua Jia","Kaishun Wu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082029,"objectID":"2ec6f999fff2a1c59ef001d8e799f641","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/20-jsac-neuroiw/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:13:48.429613Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/20-jsac-neuroiw/","section":"publication","summary":"Mobile edge computing provides users with low response time and avoids unnecessary data transmission. Due to the deployment of 5G, the emerging edge systems can provide gigabit bandwidth. However, network protocols have not evolved together. In TCP, the initial congestion window (IW) is such a low value that most short flows still stay in slow start phase when finishing, and do not fully utilize available bandwidth. Naively increasing IW may result in congestion, which causes long latency. Moreover, since the network environment is dynamic, we have a challenging problem-how to adaptively adjust IW such that flow completion time is optimized, while congestion is minimized. In this paper, we propose an adaptive online decision method to solve the problem, which learns the best policy using deep reinforcement learning stably and fast. In addition, we propose an approach to further improve the performance by supervised learning, using data collected during online learning. We also propose to adopt SDN to address the challenges in implementing our method in MEC systems. To evaluate our method, we build an MEC simulator based on ns3. Our simulations demonstrate that our method performs better than existing methods.

These applications normally demand concurrent data transfers among computing nodes for parallel processing. It is important to find the best transfer scheduling leading to the least data retrieval time-the maximum throughput in other words. However, the existing methods cannot achieve this, because they ignore link bandwidths and the diversity of data replicas and paths. In this paper, we aim to develop a max-throughput data transfer scheduling to minimize the data retrieval time of applications. Specifically, the problem is formulated into mixed integer programming, and an approximation algorithm is proposed, with its approximation ratio analyzed.

In SDN, the controllers are responsible for exchanging information with the switches to perform specific operations such as data forwarding. The transmission of control traffic usually uses networks different from data networks. However, building an additional wired network for the control traffic leads to high cabling complexity. Since a wireless network involves almost no cabling and is easy to install, we propose a wireless solution where switches make a wireless connection with controllers via wireless access points (AP). In this design, switches are divided into clusters, and an AP is placed at the center of each cluster. An important issue is to determine the minimum number of APs such that a given control traffic demand can be met. We propose an analytical model to evaluate the system throughput for possible clusterings, and an efficient algorithm to search for the optimal one.

However, traditional approaches could not avoid the service interruption completely. Moreover, they often result in longer delay and are prone to failures. In this paper, we leverage the emerging named data networking (NDN) to design an efficient and robust protocol to support seamless virtual machine migration in cloud data center. Specifically, virtual machines (VMs) are named with the services they provide. Request routing is based on service names instead of IP addresses that are normally bounded with physical machines. As such, services would not be interrupted when migrating supported VMs to different physical machines. We further analyze the performance of our proposed NDN-based VM migration protocol, and optimize its performance via a load balancing algorithm. Our extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach and demonstrate that it is interruption-free.","tags":["Cloud Computing; Virtual Machine Migration"],"title":"Supporting Seamless Virtual Machine Migration via Named Data Networking in Cloud Data Center","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kan Yang","Xiaohua Jia","Kui Ren","Ruitao Xie","Liusheng Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1396310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663082028,"objectID":"fea0e7cd9451cc00285702262471b7a0","permalink":"https://rtxie.github.io/en/publication/14-infocom-ac/","publishdate":"2022-09-13T15:13:47.729185Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/14-infocom-ac/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the high volume and velocity of big data, it is an effective option to store big data in the cloud, because the cloud has capabilities of storing big data and processing high volume of user access requests. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a promising technique to ensure the end-to-end security of big data in the cloud. However, the policy updating has always been a challenging issue when ABE is used to construct access control schemes. A trivial implementation is to let data owners retrieve the data and re-encrypt it under the new access policy, and then send it back to the cloud. This method incurs a high communication overhead and heavy computation burden on data owners. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enabling efficient access control with dynamic policy updating for big data in the cloud. We focus on developing an outsourced policy updating method for ABE systems. Our method can avoid the transmission of encrypted data and minimize the computation work of data owners, by making use of the previously encrypted data with old access policies.

Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising technique for access control of encrypted data. However, due to the inefficiency of decryption and revocation, existing CP-ABE schemes cannot be directly applied to construct a data access control scheme for multiauthority cloud storage systems, where users may hold attributes from multiple authorities. In this paper, we propose data access control for multiauthority cloud storage (DAC-MACS), an effective and secure data access control scheme with efficient decryption and revocation. Specifically, we construct a new multiauthority CP-ABE scheme with efficient decryption, and also design an efficient attribute revocation method that can achieve both forward security and backward security.

In this paper, we study such a VM allocation problem. Given a set VMs and a set of servers in a data center, each VM has a resource demand (CPU, memory, storage) and a starting time and a finishing time, and each server has resource capacity. There is an additional energy cost for a server to switch from power-saving state to active state. The servers are non-homogeneous. The problem of our concern is to allocate the VMs onto servers, such that the VMs resource demands can be met and the total energy consumption of servers is minimized.
