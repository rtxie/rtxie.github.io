 abstract = {Leveraging emerging mobile edge computing and 5G networks, researchers proposed to offload the 3D rendering of interactive applications (e.g. virtual reality and cloud gaming onto GPU-based edge servers to reduce the user experienced latency. A task offloading problem arises, that is where to offload rendering tasks such that each user will experience tolerable delay and meanwhile the cost of used servers is minimized. The multi-dimensional resource sharing feature of rendering tasks makes the problem challenging. We formulate the task offloading problem into a boolean linear programming. We propose a sharing-aware offloading algorithm which decomposes the problem into two subproblems (user assignment and server packing and solves them alternately and iteratively. We compare our algorithm with the one without resource sharing in consideration, and the simulations demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce cost as well as satisfy delay requirement.},
