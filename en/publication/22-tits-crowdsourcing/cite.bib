 abstract = {By providing rich context of lane information on roads, lane-level maps play a vital role in intelligent transportation systems. Since Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have been widely applied to vehicles, vehicle-based crowdsourcing offers an economical way to the lane-level map building by collecting and analyzing the GPS trajectories of vehicles. However, existing works cannot directly extract lane-level road information from raw and interleaved crowdsourcing trajectories, and moreover they are time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose a lane-level map building scheme, which can directly extract lane-level road information from raw crowdsourcing GPS trajectories with both efficiency and accuracy improvement. Consider the global similarity between trajectories, we design an efficient trajectory segmentation and clustering algorithm based on improved discrete Fr√©chet distance and entropy theory, which can directly and accurately deal with the interleaved and messy trajectories. To improve the efficiency, we employ the Least Square Estimate (LSE) to constrain Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and design an efficient and accurate lane-level road information extraction algorithm. Comprehensive comparative experiments and performance evaluation on a real-world trajectory dataset show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.},
