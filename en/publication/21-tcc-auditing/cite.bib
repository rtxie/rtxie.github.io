 abstract = {Public auditing schemes for cloud storage systems have been extensively explored with the increasing importance of data integrity. A third-party auditor (TPA) is introduced in public auditing schemes to verify the integrity of outsourced data on behalf of users. To resist malicious TPAs, many blockchain-based public verification schemes have been proposed. However, existing auditing schemes rely on a centralized TPA, and they are vulnerable to tempting auditors who may collude with malicious blockchain miners to produce biased auditing results. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized public auditing (BDPA) scheme by utilizing a decentralized blockchain network to undertake the responsibility of a centralized TPA, and also mitigate the influence of tempting auditors and malicious blockchain miners by taking the concept of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). A detailed security analysis shows that BDPA can preserve data integrity against tempting auditors and malicious blockchain miners. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that BDPA is feasible and scalable.},
